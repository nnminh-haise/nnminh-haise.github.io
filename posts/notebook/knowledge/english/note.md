## Conjuctions reviews

### Basic knowledge

#### Coordinating conjuction

- Coordination conjuctions are used to join two parts of a sentence that are grammatically equal.

    - *The two parts maybe single words or a clauses.*
    - *Examples:*
        
        - Jack **and** Jill went up the hill.
        - The water was warm, **but** I did not go swimming.

- Coordinating conjuctions always come **between** the words or clauses that they join.
- A coordinating conjuction shows that the elements it joins are similar in importance and structure.

    - There are seven coordinating conjuctions: *and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so.*
    - *Examples:*

        - I like [coffee] **and** [tea].
        - [Ram likes tea] **but** [Anthony likes coffee].

- When a coordinating conjuction joins independent clauses, it is always correct to place a commma before the conjuction.

    - I want to work as an interpreter in the future, **so** I am studying Russia at university. 

- However, if the independent clauses are short and well-balanced, a comma is not really essensial.

    - She is so kind **so** she helps people.

- When "and" is used with the last word of a list, a comma is optional.

    - He drinks beer, whisky, wine, **and** rum.
    - He drinks beer, whisky, wine **and** rum.

***Table of coordinating conjuction:***

| F | A | N | B | O | Y | S |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| for | and | not | but | or | yet | so | 


#### Subordinating conjuction

- Subordinating conjuctions are used to join a subordinate (dependent) clause to a main (indepentdent) clause.

    - Example:

        - I went swimming, **although** it was cold.

- Some common subordinating conjuctions:

    - after, although, as, because, before, how, if, once, since, than, that, though, till, until, when, where, whether, why.

- Subordinating conjuctions usually come at the beginning of the subordinating clause. It "introduces" a subordinate clause. However, a subordinate clause can come after or before a main clause.

    - Ram went swimming **although it was rainning**.
    - **Although it was rainning**, Ram went swimming.

- A subordinate (independent) clause "depends" on a main (independent) clause. It cannot exist alone.



***Some sample conjuctions:***

| Coordinating conjuctions | Subordination conjuctions |
| :--- | :--- |
| and, or, but, nor, for, yet, so | although, because, since, unless |

***Conjuctions have three basic formats:***

- Single word:

    - *Example: and, but, because, although.*

- Compound:

    - *Example: provided that, as long as, in order that.*

- Correlative:

    - *Example: so...that*
